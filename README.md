# simple_shell
This project is a replica of a shell created by Gold Israel and Celeb Akpe. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with their computer's operating system.

To use the shell, simply run the "hsh" file. This will launch the command-line interface, where you can enter commands just as you would in a regular terminal.

This project was created for educational purposes, and is not intended for use in production environments. Use at your own risk.
